3. When is it appropriate to use the Abstract Factory design pattern?
Use the Abstract Factory pattern when you want to ability to create families of related classes
but don't want to explicitly specify the class of objects until runtime. The pattern allows
a client to switch between different families of classes at runtime (but does not allow mixing of
objects from different families).
