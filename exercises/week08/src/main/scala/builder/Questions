5. “In general, the details of object construction, such as instantiating and
initialising the components that comprise the object, are kept within the
object, often as part of its constructor.”

Comment on this statement with reference to modularity and construction bloat.

The approach described above is appropriate for simple objects for which the construction
process always produces the same representation of the object. As objects become more complex
and the components making up the object are allowed to vary, however, the above approach
becomes less effective, as this would require different implementations of the construction
process to be kept within the object for each variation. This leads to lots of constructor
code within the object (construction bloat) and reduces the modularity of the object, as the
individual components of the object are tightly bound to the object within the constructor code.
