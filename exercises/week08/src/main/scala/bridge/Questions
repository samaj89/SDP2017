9. When should one make use of the Bridge Design Pattern?

Use the Bridge design pattern when a given abstraction may have several implementations,
but you wish to avoid permanently binding the implementation to the abstraction (i.e. via
inheritance) so as to allow both the implementation and the abstraction to vary independently.
This allows an implementation to be modified or switched out for another at runtime.
