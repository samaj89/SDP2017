(a) What is the Facade Pattern?
The Facade Pattern provides a simple high-level interface to a set of interfaces within
a subsystem, with the aim of making the subsystem easier to use.

(b) When, and why, would you use the Facade Pattern?
Providing a simple interface to a complex system shields the client from complexity provided
by the lower level interfaces: the client sends request to the facade interface, which translates
and handles communication between the subsystem interfaces. The facade therefore acts to decouple
interfaces within the subsystem.
